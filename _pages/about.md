Mr. Panagiotis T. Karfakis obtained his B.Sc., Electronic Computer Systems Engineering, from the Pireaus Univesity of Applied Sciences (PUAS), Athens, Greece and his M.Sc. Robotics degree from Cranfield University, Bedfordshire, United Kingdom. He is currently pursuing his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Coimbra. Professionaly held engineering and research positions throughout the past years as a robotics engineer, and has obtained cross discipline experience in fields of aerial, offshore, subsea, inspection, maintenance and space robotics. Other topics of interest include 5G communications, robot localization, sensor fusion and SLAM. P.T Karfakis has published and co-authored articles in international conferences and is currently researching the topic of "Cooperative and Multimodal Localization in 5G enabled Multi Robot Systems" as part of his doctoral activities. P.T. Karfakis has also coordinated 2 R&D projects for the offshore renewables industry, iFROG and ROBFMS, in Cambridge, UK and has participated in multiple EU projects. Currently, he holds the position of Robotics Researcher at Ingeniarius Lda, as part of the European Union's MSCA-ITN 5GSmartFact project, which objective is to research the deployment of 5G networks for IIoT in factory environments, and exploit them to support networked robot architectures and hence a leap forward in industrial automation.
