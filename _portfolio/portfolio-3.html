title: "5GSmartFact project"
excerpt: "At part of this MSCA-ITN doctoral study, as a Robotics Researcher, I play a key role in contributing to the 5GSmartFact objectives, emphasizing on mobile robot 5G-enabled localization systems to support industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) applications. Absolute localization of mobile robots without knowledge of an environment map, typical in many I4.0 domains, rely on technologies such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS), whose accuracy and precision fall short for many robotic tasks, and has limited applicability indoors. Some recent works addressed the localization accuracy of 5G networks found to be at the cm-level. Adding this to other prospects in 5G networks, such as increased bandwidth, or device-to-device communication, paves the way towards the development and deployment of 5G-enabled field robotsâ€™ localization. Currently, there exists a plethora of different use case-specific technologies for positioning, e.g., based on ultra-sound, cameras, laser, LiDAR, ultra-wideband or Bluetooth, which are complex to manage and costly to deploy altogether. Also, legacy technologies, such as RFID, though quite cost-efficient, are too rigid and inflexible. What is missing to date is a highly flexible and powerful positioning solution that is suitable for a wide range of different use cases and requirements and that is ideally integrated into the already deployed connectivity infrastructure, thus avoiding the need to set up and operate parallel multiple networks, infrastructures, or technologies.
To tackle the aforementioned challenges, the objectives for this doctoral study are as follows: 1) Analysis of user needs and requirements for the design of 5G-connected heterogeneous robotic platforms, based on 5G  New Radio (NR) connectivity for pervasive localization, emphasizing on triangulation, multilateration, and fingerprinting optimization methods, as well as cooperative and multimodal-based localization. 2) Implementation of a Robot OS (ROS)-based solution for 5G Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approach in robotics. 3) Development of an advanced life-long localization architecture based on multimodal sensor fusion, encompassing 5G technology, possibly coupled with local ultrawide-band positioning, VLC, Global Navigation Sattelite Systems (GNSS), Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), wheel encoders, scan LiDAR and visual odometry. 4) Performance evaluation approach to assess the accuracy and precision of the 5G-based localization as a distributive multi-robot system under real-world constraints.
