title: "5GSmartFact project"
excerpt: "At the outset of the doctoral study, the ESR will play a key role in contributing to the 5GSmartFact objectives, emphasizing on mobile robot 5G-enabled localization systems to support industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) applications. Absolute localization of mobile robots without knowledge of an environment map, typical in many I4.0 domains, rely on technologies such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS), whose accuracy and precision fall short for many robotic tasks, and has limited applicability indoors. Some recent works addressed the localization accuracy of 5G networks found to be at the cm-level. Adding this to other prospects in 5G networks, such as increased bandwidth, or device-to-device communication, paves the way towards the development and deployment of 5G-enabled field robotsâ€™ localization. Currently, there exists a plethora of different use case-specific technologies for positioning, e.g., based on ultra-sound, cameras, laser, LiDAR, ultra-wideband or Bluetooth, which are complex to manage and costly to deploy altogether. Also, legacy technologies, such as RFID, though quite cost-efficient, are too rigid and inflexible. What is missing to date is a highly flexible and powerful positioning solution that is suitable for a wide range of different use cases and requirements and that is ideally integrated into the already deployed connectivity infrastructure, thus avoiding the need to set up and operate parallel multiple networks, infrastructures, or technologies.

The ESR will address the following challenges for positioning in the IIoT space: a) Development of hybrid positioning techniques for mobile robots based on 5G communications. b) Rich fusion of different sources of positioning information (ultrawideband, inertial data, visual odometry, visible light communications, etc.) and context information for a diversity of use cases and applications, and implementation in a robot system. <br/>[Link to project website](https://5gsmartfact.upc.edu/)"
