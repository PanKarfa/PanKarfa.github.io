title: "iFROG project"
excerpt: "I have been the Project Engineer & Manager of the iFROG project during my employment at InnotecUK, Cambridge, UK. An amphibious robot capable of working in teams to clean and inspect monopiles above water level and up to 60 metres below (~6 bar), has successfully completed trials at the ORE Catapultâ€™s National Renewable Energy Centre in Blyth Northumberland,UK for a duration of 3.5 years. The development started from scratch and we had to go through the conceptualization and iterative developments of a hybrid robotic platform suitable for the offshore wind industries. Fortunately, we managed to break through the hurdles of this massive engineering effort across all teams including Mechanical, Electrical and Software, generating two highly robust robots for non destruvtive testing (NDT) and water jet cleaning. A project funded by innovate uk from 2018 until 2021 and at the final stage, iFROG was deployed on monopile structures on land and in sea at ORE Catapult's national renewable energy centre in Blyth, Northumberland, UK for real-world demonstrations of its capabilities. As part of the project, collaborated with Brunel's Innovation Center (BIC), The Welding Institute (TWI) and Offshore Renewable Catapult (OREC) has generated valuable experience in engineering solutions for offshore wind assets and has ensured that iFROG meets the industry requirements specifications. This platform served as a stepping stone towards commercially ready robotic platforms for inspection and maintenance. The problem that we were tackling at the time concerned the race towards net zero targets, the  acceleration of offshore wind growth and pushing of farm sites into ever deeper waters. Hence the operational landscape was envisaged to change too, as  robotics and autonomous systems offer a ticket to reduced human deployment offshore, a chance to reduce costs and to improve asset integrity through predictive maintenance.The outputs of the project consist of: (i) a amphibious robotic team that can navigate turbine monopole walls using a magnetic adhesion above/below water (IP68), (ii) conduct non-destructive ultrasonic testing of monopole surfaces for corrosion loss of steel wall integrity, (iii) biofouling  removal, (iv) Predictive analytics by combining inspection data with material properties and asset history and degradation pathways.
