title: "ROBFMS project"
excerpt: "The ROBFMS project was the robotic product ready version of the iFROG project that I had the responsibility of managing as the Project Engineer from 2020 to 2021. Standing amidst powerful waves in briny waters, offshore wind turbines can suffer from rust, corrosion and eventually cracking of their foundations. Over time, they also accumulate weighty masses of algae and other microorganisms that can create drag, impede technicians trying to work on them and ultimately undermine and reduce turbines lifetimes at sea. Sending divers to the depths of the ocean for maintenance and cleaning of subsea structures is a risky business that entails long delays, as seas are in unsafe conditions for much of time, due to the harsh environment in which marine energy assets operate. An estimated 65% of the total lifetime operating costs are related to inspection and maintenance equipment, so operators have to combat corrosion, fouling and fatigue of the structures. The nature of the operating environment including the splash zone represent major challenges for traditional inspection techniques such as divers and ROV's. ROBFMS represents the latest stage of this development, a robotic platform for external cleaning of steel structures used in the offshore wind and marine industries and can carry out not just a visual check, but a full NDT inspection carrying a varying payload of different equipment as attachments and cleaning of problematic bio fouling. It can do this quickly enough and with great precision while repeatability is the aim of any maintenance tasks. ROBFMS is the latest chapter in this success story the project funded by innovate uk linked long-standing partners such as Brunel Innovation Center (BIC) with the European Marine Energy Center (EMEC), the world's first and leading facility for testing wave and tidal energy converters in Orkney Islands Scotland. It has inherited all the leading features from its predecessor (iFROG): (i) easy to control remote operation, (ii) reliable adhesion performing flawlessly on external steel surfaces of large structures and (iii) subsea design, (iv) ruggedized cage for even more compact transportion to offshore using small vessels and minimal crews. The improved robotic platform can still carry a significant payload and is fully compatible with NDT probes and pressure jetting-based cleaning systems. Used as a base it can create a team of inspection robots that perform various operational tasks on site and offer remote control by inspection teams and data collection capabilities. These smart robotic assistants could help offshore asset operators protect human workers from hazardous environments and effectively predict major faults using the collective data. they are capable of contributing to the maintenance schedule optimization and as a result to a reduction in inspection and maintenance costs leading to decrease to consumer energy prices.<br/>[Link to project video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KYhJjmk5II)"
