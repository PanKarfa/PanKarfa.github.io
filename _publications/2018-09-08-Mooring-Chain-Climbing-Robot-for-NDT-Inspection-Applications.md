excerpt: 'Inspection of mooring chains is an important but dangerous and costly procedure covering inspection above and below the waterline. The paper presents initial results from the RIMCAW project which aimed at designing and building an inspection robot able to climb mooring chains and deploy NDT technologies for scanning individual links thereby detecting critical defects. The paper focuses on the design and realisation of the inchworm type novel crawler developed and tested in the TWI Middlesbrough, UK water tank'
