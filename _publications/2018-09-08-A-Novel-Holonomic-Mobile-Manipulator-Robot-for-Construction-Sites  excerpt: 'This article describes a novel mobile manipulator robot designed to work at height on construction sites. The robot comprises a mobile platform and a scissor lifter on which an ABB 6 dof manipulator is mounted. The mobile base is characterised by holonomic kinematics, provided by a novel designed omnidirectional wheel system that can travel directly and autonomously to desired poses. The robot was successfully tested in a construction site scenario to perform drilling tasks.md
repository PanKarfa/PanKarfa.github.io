excerpt: 'This article describes a novel mobile manipulator robot designed to work at height on construction sites. The robot comprises a mobile platform and a scissor lifter on which an ABB 6 dof manipulator is mounted. The mobile base is characterised by holonomic kinematics, provided by a novel designed omnidirectional wheel system that can travel directly and autonomously to desired poses. The robot was successfully tested in a construction site scenario to perform drilling tasks.'
